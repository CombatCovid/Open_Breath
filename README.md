### Background & Need

Open Breath project aims at the development and production of a scalable low-cost lung ventilator. Open Breath lung ventilator presents an innovative design, conceived to be quickly realized with off-the-shelflow-cost hardware components.



## Main Features
- Innovative design based on the automatization of a bag-valve-mask (BVM)
- Quickly producible with "off-the-shelf" parts
- Extremely low cost
- Both invasive and non-invasive assisted ventilation: PEEP, SIMV, CPAP modes
- Aims at compliance with the BS EN 80601-2-12:2020 standard
- Connected device and live interface:
- Sensors: pressure, flowrate
- Provides blood oxygenation rate and heart rate (nice to have)
- Will send alerts and updates in real-time directly to healthcare professionals
- We invite anyone who is interested to follow this work.


## Status of Development

The device is currently under development, a first metal prototype has been realized.

| Date   | Event |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| 01/03/2020  | Start of project in response to COVID-19 health emergency. Start on Openbreath.it  |
| 20/03/2020  | Need help from a Biomed apparatus certifier.  |
| 28/03/2020  | Need help from sheet metal workshop in and outside of Europe - first CAD Release Online  |
| 03/04/2020  | First Metal Prototype has been realized and the testing phase has started |

## How to replicate 

For assembeling the main body of the device sheet metal must be cut with a lasercutter and folded. 

DFX files for cutting can be downloaded [**HERE**](https://www.ohwr.org/project/openbreath/tree/master/CAD/DXF) <!-- Replace with github link -->

The hardware files for electronics can be downloaded [**HERE**](https://www.ohwr.org/project/openbreath/tree/master/Hardware) <!-- Replace with github link -->

The dashboard files can be download [**HERE**](https://www.ohwr.org/project/openbreath/tree/master/Dashboard) <!-- Replace with github link -->


<!-- # Steps to start documenting the equipment/design you found and chose 
[See this documentation example](https://github.com/CombatCovid/medical-shields-for-3d-printing). You can also download it to see the final result.
1. Download or clone this template to start documenting easily
2. Fill in the source files like STLS, CAD, etc inside

3. Use this one template to create new designs documentation
- Inside docs write down a simple README in language of choice.
- Put in the README.md the reference whre you got the source from to follow up.
- Write down steps to replicate if necessesary as well as guides in sequence.
If this part becomes difficult ask for help here in the [`#how-to-document-designs` channel ](https://discord.gg/QrAyWF)
